Tic-Tac-Toe in Rust
A simple command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Rust, where two players alternate placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 board. The program accepts user input for selecting positions and handles errors like invalid input or out-of-range positions.

Features
Players take turns to input their move by specifying the position on a 3x3 grid.
The game alternates between two players, "X" and "O".
The input is validated to ensure:
The position is between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
The position is not already occupied.
If the user types quit, the game will end.
Simple error handling for invalid input.
